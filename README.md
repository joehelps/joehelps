# Welcome, I’m Joe Helps!

I'm a research scientist, using computational methods to analyse agricultural problems, primarily diseases, but also insect pests and weeds.

I mostly work in R and Shiny, but dabble with C++ (and Rcpp) and Python.

I’m currently working on two EU Horizon 2020 projects - [IPM Decisions](https://www.ipmdecisions.net/) and [IWM Praise](https://iwmpraise.eu/).

Interested in anything modelling: mechanistic, empirical, machine-learning...
